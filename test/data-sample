Introduction
Lily is named after a girl's name.

Lily is used to preview compressed file before decompressing it. Before
decompressing a tar file, a zip file or whatever compressed file, one
would like to first list the contents of the file using commands like
unzip -l xx.zip, tar -tvf xxx.tar.gz. This script will choose the right
command for commonly used compressed file extension.
